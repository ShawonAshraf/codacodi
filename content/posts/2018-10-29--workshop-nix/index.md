## Notes before coming to the workshop
-  Bring your laptop and make sure it's fully charged! 
-  Download the `Ubuntu 18.04 Image` __(32 bit if you're already using 32 bit OS, 64 bit otherwise)__
-  Download and install `Oracle VirtualBox`. You can find the download link [here](https://www.virtualbox.org)
-  If you own a `MacBook/MacBook Pro/MacBook Air`, you can skip installing `Ubuntu`, you can follow along without that as well. However, there's no problem if you install `Ubuntu` on VirtualBox.
-  Keep a fresh mind. There'll be a lot of theoretical stuff to bore you up. If drinking water makes you feel better in such situations, feel free to do so ðŸ¤“
-  Mac users - please make sure to have [Atom](https://atom.io) / [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed to make writing some stuff in an easier way.
-  Don't be shy to ask questions. I may not know everything but I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can.

## Installing Ubuntu on VirtualBox on Windows
__Because it's pretty straightforward on macOS, ahem!__

## Step - 1 : Check if your CPU supports Virtualization
If your CPU doesn't support `virtualization` you won't be able to run VirtualBox.

So to check that, open `Task Manager`, then go to `Performance` tab, and check if `virtualization` is enabled or not. If it's disabled, than go to BIOS of your computer and enable `Intel Virtualization Technology`, `Intel VT-d` or just `Virtualization` - whatever your computer supports. Then come back to `Task Manager` and check again. It it's enabled, you're good to go.

## Step - 2 : Now open up VirtualBox

It should look like this -

Now, for some people, even after turning on Virtualization, the option to install __64 bit OS__ won't show up. That's because you've Hyper-V enabled on Windows and you've to disable that. Follow [this guide to disable hyper-v](http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2014/11/virtualbox-showing-32-bit-guest-versions-64-bit-host-os/)

Now go on and give your `Virtual Machine` a name. For example, I've named it as `UbuntuVM`.

## Step - 3 : Configure VM

Now you need to configure `RAM`, create `Virtual Hard Drives` and etc. Follow along as the images go.

## Step - 4 : Start Your Virtual Machine

When you start the `Virtual Machine`, VirtualBox will ask for the boot image, which is your `Ubuntu Installation image`. Point to that using the folder icon on the prompt and then click on Start.

## Step - 5 : Install Ubuntu

When Ubuntu starts up it'll ask you whether you want to install Ubuntu or just try it out. Click on `Install Ubuntu`.

Now just go on and select your keyboard layout and installation options as shown.

Keyboard                      |   Installation              |

Now for the tricky part. You need to partition the `Virtual Hard Drive`. You can just go on and click on Erase and use all the disk space but let's get to know how partitioning works here. 

Create a new partitoning tabel, then, create two partions, one with 500MB and `/boot` mount point and another with the rest of the space and `/` mount point. (just recall what you saw in the workshop).

Now just go on and click on "Install Now" and the rest of the process is just Continue Yes No stuff. And yes, don't forget about this one!

You're done installing, now go on and start using Ubuntu!
