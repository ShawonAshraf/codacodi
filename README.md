## What's this for?
This one's gonna serve as the dev repo for my github pages site. Yeah I know I can use a separate branch but what if I want to publish this elsewhere in the future? Let's just be on the portable side of the force!

## Template from?
I'm using the [gatsby-starter-hero-blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog) by [greglobinski](https://github.com/greglobinski).
